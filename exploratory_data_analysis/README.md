# Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis 

## Process

### 1. Create folders for logs/ and outputs/

- add logging to any exploratory analysis scripts
- helps to track which files loaded and if data operations were successful
- outputs provides the result of those operations, i.e. the data summary

### 2. Create data profiling script

- get an understanding of the data without manually going through and checking relationships 

### 3. Create script for checking relationships between csvs using ID column

- name for id columns across csvs vary 
- need to check which columns align to which

### 4. Check assumptions about the data

- for future reference
- good to know which ints / dates needs converting, which columns have nonsensical values etc
